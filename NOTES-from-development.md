### Notes
this app is based on the academind videos about [reactjs-basic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS), and I will follow a new branch by video.

The playlist of videos was created on 14 dic. 2017, and now we're on 16 feb. 2019, and the  reactjs version was change,
in other things I'am using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#create-react-app--) V2.1.1, and that explain why there are some diferencies on the react implementation,
overall on the way in how react is extended and implemented
eg:
```javascript

```
